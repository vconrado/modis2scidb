SciETL is built on top of Boost libraries. You will need to have them installed in order to build SciETL. Make sure to have at least version 1.54.0 installed.

Bash script for building all dependencies on Linux Ubuntu 14.04
----------------------------------------------------------------

We have prepared a special bash script for this purpose on Linux Ubuntu 14.04. This script can be found in SciETL source tree under https://github.com/e-sensing/scietl/tree/master/install/install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh.

Follow the steps below:
- Download the third-party libraries package used by the development team: http://www.dpi.inpe.br/esensing-devel/scietl-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz.

- Copy the script install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh to the same folder you have downloaded the scietl-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.tar.gz.

- Open the shell command line and call the script install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh setting the target to install all the stuffs from these third-party libraries and tools:
  $ SCIETL_DEPENDENCIES_DIR="/home/user/mylibs" ./install-3rdparty-linux-ubuntu-14.04.sh
